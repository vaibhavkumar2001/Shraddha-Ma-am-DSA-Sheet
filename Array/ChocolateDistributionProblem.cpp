// C++ program to solve chocolate distribution
// problem using Sliding Window

// üß† Problem Summary:
// You are given an array of integers, arr[], where each element is the number of chocolates in a packet.

// You have m students and need to give one packet to each student.

// Your goal is to choose m packets such that the difference between the max and min chocolates in those packets is as small as possible.

// üîç Step-by-Step Intuition:
// 1. What does the problem want?
// We are trying to minimize the difference between the max and min in any subset of m packets.

// 2. Can we brute force it?
// Yes, but it would be very inefficient:


// 3. Is there a pattern or shortcut?
// Yes! Think about this:

// If we sort the array, then the elements that are close together (i.e., in a sliding window) are most likely to have small differences between max and min.

// Once sorted, you just have to look at all contiguous subarrays (windows) of size m.

// üí° That‚Äôs the key insight:
// After sorting, the optimal group of m packets must lie in some contiguous subarray of size m.

// ü™ü Sliding Window Approach:
// Sort the array.

// Slide a window of size m from index 0 to n - m.

// For each window:

// Difference = arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i]

// Keep track of the minimum difference.

// ‚úÖ Why it works:
// After sorting, the smallest range of m packets will be in a window of m consecutive sorted elements. This is because spreading the elements apart would increase the max-min difference.
